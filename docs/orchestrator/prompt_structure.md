# Prompt Structure and Engineering

## Prompt Components

Effective agent prompts include:

1. **Mission**: Clear task description
2. **Inputs**: What data the agent receives
3. **Outputs**: Expected output format
4. **Done When**: Completion criteria
5. **Constraints**: Limitations and rules
6. **RAG Instructions**: How to use knowledge base

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

- Be explicit about expectations
- Provide examples when helpful
- Use structured format for clarity
- Include context about available tools
- Reference knowledge base usage

## RAG Integration

Always include instructions for:
- When to retrieve knowledge
- Which domain KB to use
- How to incorporate retrieved context
- What to do if no context is found

## Iterative Refinement

- Test prompts with sample inputs
- Refine based on agent outputs
- A/B test different prompt structures
- Document what works well
