- Follow `.cursor/rules.md` for coding, reviews, and security.
- Make atomic edits scoped to a single task.
- Respect repository boundaries and avoid unrelated refactors.
- Cite sources with file paths and commit hashes when referencing existing code.
- Prefer branch-local artifacts; if unavailable, use `main`.
- Keep outputs within token limits; move large context to files under `docs/`.
